## OUR OWN COURSE POLICIES

Our own course policies include: 

- *Late work*. Any work submitted past the due date will receive an automatic 10% reduction unless due to a pre-approved excused absence. Any work turned in over one week past the due date may not be accepted without prior approval. 
- *Working together*. You are welcome and expected to work together on assignments and projects. However, each student must undertake their own analyses, make their own maps, produce their own figures, conduct their own peer reviews and contribute to the production of group reports. Specific guidelines for these expectations will be provided on each assignment. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Copying figures or text without appropriate citations or permission will not be tolerated. 
- *Academic Dishonesty*. Use common sense. Don’t cheat.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES

 In addition, we adhere to the [University’s course policies](http://catalog.usu.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=3583):

### ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES (FACULTY CODE)
Academic freedom is the right to teach, study, discuss, investigate, discover, create, and publish freely. Academic freedom protects the rights of faculty members in teaching and of students in learning. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in teaching, research, and creative activities, subject to the limitations imposed by professional responsibility. Faculty Code Policy #403 further defines academic freedom and professional responsibilities: USU Policies Section 403

### GRIEVANCE PROCESS (STUDENT CODE)
Students who feel they have been unfairly treated [in matters other than (i) discipline or (ii) admission, residency, employment, traffic, and parking - which are addressed by procedures separate and independent from the Student Code] may file a grievance through the channels and procedures described in the Student Code: Article VII Grievances .PLAGIARISMPlagiarism includes knowingly "representing, by paraphrase or direct quotation, the published or unpublished work of another person as one's own in any academic exercise or activity without full and clear acknowledgment. It also includes the unacknowledged used of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials." The penalties for plagiarism are severe. They include warning or reprimand, grade adjustment, probation, suspension, expulsion, withholding of transcripts, denial or revocation of degrees, and referral to psychological counseling. 

### STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 
The Americans with Disabilities Act states: "Reasonable accommodation will be provided for all persons with disabilities in order to ensure equal participation within the program. If a student has a disability that will likely require some accommodation by the instructor, the student must contact the instructor and document the disability through the Disability Resource Center (797-2444), preferably during the first week of the course. Any request for special consideration relating to attendance, pedagogy, taking of examinations, etc., must be discussed with and approved by the instructor. In cooperation with the Disability Resource Center, course materials can be provided in alternative format, large print, audio, diskette, or Braille."  Withdrawal Policy and "I" 

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY - "THE HONOR SYSTEM"
Each student has the right and duty to pursue his or her academic experience free of dishonesty. The Honor System is designed to establish the higher level of conduct expected and required of all Utah State University students.   The Honor Pledge: To enhance the learning environment at Utah State University and to develop student academic integrity, each student agrees to the following Honor Pledge: "I pledge, on my honor, to conduct myself with the foremost level of academic integrity." A student who lives by the Honor Pledge is a student who does more than not cheat, falsify, or plagiarize. A student who lives by the Honor Pledge: Espouses academic integrity as an underlying and essential principle of the Utah State University community; Understands that each act of academic dishonesty devalues every degree that is awarded by this institution; and Is a welcomed and valued member of Utah State University. 

### SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
Sexual harassment is defined by the Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as any "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature." If you feel you are a victim of sexual harassment, you may talk to or file a complaint with the Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity Office located in Old Main, Room 161, or call the AA/EEO Office at 797-1266. 

### GRADE POLICY
Students are required to complete all courses for which they are registered by the end of the semester. In some cases, a student may be unable to complete all of the coursework because of extenuating circumstances, but not due to poor performance or to retain financial aid. The term 'extenuating' circumstances includes: (1) incapacitating illness which prevents a student from attending classes for a minimum period of two weeks, (2) a death in the immediate family, (3) financial responsibilities requiring a student to alter a work schedule to secure employment, (4) change in work schedule as required by an employer, or (5) other emergencies deemed appropriate by the instructor. |
