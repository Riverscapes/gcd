title: Recap of Workshop
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

#### Why we're Covering it

- The workshop is designed as a firehose of information, but this website is organized to help you digest and access that information in a useful way as you move forward and potentially begin to apply the principles covered here. The synthesis is a chance to pull all that scattered information we've thrown at you in the past three days and put it back together into some coherent take home points. 


- To give the group an opportunity to choose change detection topics and/or applications of specific interest to them to learn more about.

- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
