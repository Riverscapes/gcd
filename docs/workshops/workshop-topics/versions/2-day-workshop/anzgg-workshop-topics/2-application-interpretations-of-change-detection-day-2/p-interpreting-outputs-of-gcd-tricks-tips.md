title: Interpreting Outputs of GCD & Tricks & Tips
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

This will be a brief guided discussion and exercise on how to interpret the primary outputs of a change detection analysis. Namely, we will look at `Summary.xml`output tables, the elevation change distributions and the raster DoDs.

#### Why we're Covering it

Any monkey can press the buttons of the GCD software... we want to make sure you understand what it means and how to interpret it.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD)through group-led and self-paced exercises
