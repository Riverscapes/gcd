title: Transient Storage
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

Transient storage is defined a the total thickness over a given time period that has experienced topographic change (Hazel et al. 2006; Schmidt & Grams 2011). When you have more then three DEMs, you can perform a transient storage analysis by first deriving the minimum and  maximum elevations over the entire time period for a given time series of topography. You then subtract the minimum from the maximum to get your transient storage thickness. In this lecture, we will show you how to do this analysis and discuss how you might interpret it. 

#### Why we're Covering it

This is a useful tool for identifying hotspots of change.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
