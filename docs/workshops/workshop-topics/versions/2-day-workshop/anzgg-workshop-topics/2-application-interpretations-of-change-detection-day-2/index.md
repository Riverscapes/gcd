In the morning we will wrap up some of the change detection principles we started with on [Day 1](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/workshop-topics/versions/2-day-workshop/anzgg-workshop-topics/1-surveying-principles-change-detection). After having established the foundations that enable us to undertake geomorphic change detection rigorously, we will get into the more interesting applications and interpretations of such analyses (mainly with fluvial and restoration monitoring examples). We will cover applications such as budget segregation, sediment budgeting, reservoir tools and a variety of examples of how case studies of change detection have been used to do various analyses. We will seek your feedback on ways we can improve them before they are finalized. 

In the afternoon, we will focus on reinforcing the concepts covered on [Day 1](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/workshop-topics/versions/2-day-workshop/anzgg-workshop-topics/1-surveying-principles-change-detection) through self-paced hands on exercises. Participants can choose whether to work up the data we provide, or work up their own data they may have brought with them. Either way, instructors and assistants will be on hand all afternoon to help you work through the processes of data preparation, change detection and budget segregation. In the afternoon we will cover any outstanding topics that have arisen and synthesize the course. We will also give participants an opportunity to help shape the future of the GCD Development. This day primarily focuses on the fourth and fifth of our primary learning outcomes:

- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
