---

#### Synopsis of Topic

This will be a brief guided discussion and demonstration on how to get more out of GCD. Topics will include:

- GCD Projects & Folder Structure & Outputs
- GCD Tricks & Tips
- [GCD Command Line](http://etalweb.joewheaton.org/etal_workshops/GCD/2015_USU/T_GCD_CommandLine.pdf)
- Batch Processing (demo of CHaMP Analyst Workbench)

We will save the interpretation of the primary outputs of a change detection analysis for [U. The Morphological Method & Closure of Sediment Budgets](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/workshop-topics/versions/3-day-workshop/3-Day3/u-sediment-budgets) and [V. Interpreting Morphodynamic Signatures & GCD Budget Segregation](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/workshop-topics/versions/3-day-workshop/3-Day3/v-budget-segregation). But we will take a closer look at `Summary.xml `output tables, the elevation change distributions and the raster DoDs.
