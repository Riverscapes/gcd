This intensive 3-day workshop is intended to give those interested in the geomorphic monitoring of rivers and streams the tools to interpret topographic monitoring data. Participants will come away with an understanding of the theory and tools behind geomoprhic change detection from repeat topographic surveying, as well as a working knowledge of how to apply the Geomorphic Change Detection software (provided) to their own monitoring data. Examples will be used from both baseline monitoring and post-project monitoring of restoration projects.
