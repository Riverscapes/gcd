## Participant Background

- Students/Participants are expected to have some previous GIS experience, familiarity with ArcGIS (donâ€™t need to be an expert), and some understanding of topographic data and digital elevation models.

If its been a while since you've used ArcGIS and you want a refresher, you may find these '[Getting Organized and Oriented](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented)' pages helpful, or you may find [Task 1](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/task-1---build-map) of this [Intro to GIS Lab Exercise](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01)  helpful (don't bother with the making a website portion; Task 2 and 3). 

## Hardware/ Laptop & Software  Requirements

Before you get to workshop/class, all students/participants will need:

- Their **own laptop** computer with Windows (Windows 10 recommended) and:
  - Wireless network access (to download exercises) - Note USU uses [eduroam](https://www.eduroam.us/node/2984)
  - For ArcGIS to run efficiently in Windows, 4 GB or more of RAM is recommended 
  - A mouse is strongly encouraged over a trackpad
- Required Software **Installed Before Workshop**
  - [GCD Add-In]({{ site.baseurl }}/Download/) ([Requires ArcGIS 10.4 or later]({{ site.baseurl }}/Download/about.html))
  - [GCD Standalone]({{ site.baseurl }}/Download/)
- Optional Software (NOT MANDATORY)
  - Powerful text editor, such as [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  - An easy way to unzip files, such as [7Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
  - You may find [this list of utilities](http://etal.joewheaton.org/resources/how-to-guides/reccomended-software-utilities) useful

If you are unable to get ArcGIS installed prior to the workshop, it typically takes about 30-60 minutes.  As such we sometimes schedule a help session during Registration on Day 1 in the morning (see your workshop schedule), and we will help you install it.  If you can not meet any of the above requirements, please contact [Joe Wheaton](mailto:joe.wheaton@usu.edu) prior to the workshop so we can make alternative arrangements or help you with the necessary changes. 


## Bringing Your Own Data

If you have your own repeat topographic survey data and/or surfaces that you want to analyze, feel free to bring them to the workshop. On the third day, we will have a session devoted to working through analyses on your own. We will provide a dataset you can use, or you can choose to bring your own data. Raw topographic survey data can be in tabular or text file format (e.g. `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xyz`) or in any point feature class type in ArcGIS (e.g. ShapeFiles or feature classes in file geodatabases). DEM surfaces will need to be in `.img` or `.tif`, and NOT in an ESRI raster format.
