title: C. Review of Topographic Data Sources & Surveys
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

- Ground Based

- - Total Stations
  - rtkGPS
  - ground-based LiDaR or Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS)
  - Structure from Motion (SfM)

- Boat-Based

- - Single-beam SONAR
  - Multi-beam SONAR

- Airborne

- - Photogrammetry
  - Traditinoal NIR LiDaR
  - Bathymetric Green LiDaR
  - Spectral Depth Correlation

Particularly in the fluvial environment, data from multiple platforms are combined to paint a complete topographic picture of an area.

#### Why we're Covering it

Although the majority of workshop participants will have some familiarity with topographic data and even surveying, our past experience has shown that the depth of this knowledge is highly variable. Given how fundamental these data sets are to geomorphic change detection, and how rapidly surveying technology is evolving, we feel it is essential to get everyone on the same page. We want to make sure that everyone is broadly aware of the plethora approaches available, their relative tradeoffs in cost, accuracy, and suitability under different conditions and the increasing trend to produce hybrid surveys.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

 This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
