### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

A brief paragraph about the topic

#### Why we're Covering it

A brief justification.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
