title: Applications of Change Detection
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

This lecture is intended to highlight some of the ways in which change detection can be used to explore geomorphic questions.

#### Why we're Covering it

It is easy to forget as we've focused so much on methods and software why we do geomorphic change detection in the first place. We do it to get a better understanding of the systems we are studying and to test specific hypotheses.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

 This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
