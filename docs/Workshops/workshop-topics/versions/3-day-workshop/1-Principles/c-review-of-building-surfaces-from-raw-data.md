title: Review of Building Surfaces from Raw Topographic Data
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

In this section we will go through the basics of creating topographic surfaces as raster digital elevation models from raw topographic data. We will use a standard and accepted technique of deriving a TIN first, then editing it to remove problematic interpolations, and then converting this TIN surface to a raster DEM surface.

#### Why we're Covering it

This topic will hopefully be review for many, but some of you may be either rusty on it or used to having someone else just provide the raster DEM you wish to use for change detection to you. The quality of a DEM and is subsequent utility in change detection analysis is highly dependent on the methods and care taken in deriving the surface. We are covering this topic to:

- Make sure everyone is on the same page with regards to where raster DEMs we use in change detection come from.
- Show participants some tricks in creating such surfaces that may increase their efficiency and proficiency at building surfaces.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
