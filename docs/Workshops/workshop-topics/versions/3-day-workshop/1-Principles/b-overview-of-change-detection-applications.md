title: Overview of Change Detection Applications
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

This introductory lecture is intended to highlight some of the ways in which change detection can be used to explore geomorphic questions. 

We will also ask participants to provide brief pop-up presentations of how they have, are or plant to use change detection for their own problems. We will devote this session to 2 minute pop-ups from the workshop participants to show a quick image, map or two of a project or problem they're working on where geomorphic change detection may be helpful. Pop-ups by participants are not mandatory, but we encourage you to share your GCD problems, relevant insights, or cool applications of GCD with the group. We welcome as many contributions as there are participants!

#### Why we're Covering it

It is easy to forget why we do geomorphic change detection in the first place, when so much of this workshop focuses on methods and application of those techniques using the GCD software. We should not loose sight of why we invest this effort - to get a better understanding of the systems we are studying and to test specific hypotheses. 

We have a very diverse and experienced mix of participants who have some interesting problems and insights to share with each other. Having all this expertise in one room, it is a shame not to tap it. We are using this pop-up session to help us get better acquainted with the challenges individuals are facing when it comes to geomorphic change detection and help us make adjustments as necessary to the rest of the workshop. It will also promote networking amongst the participants. 

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
