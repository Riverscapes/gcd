title: Approaches to Estimating DEM Errors
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

There are many sources of uncertainty that contribute to DEM error. In this topic, we will explore these sources of uncertainty and learn about some of the most common approaches and standards for estimating errors and doing accuracy assessments. 

#### Why we're Covering it

Independent estimates of elevation uncertainty (treated as DEM error) are a critical part of the GCD workflow. 

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
