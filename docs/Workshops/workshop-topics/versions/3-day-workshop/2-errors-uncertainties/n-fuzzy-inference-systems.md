title: Introduction to Fuzzy Error Modelling
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

Fuzzy inference systems are a powerful and flexible tool that have a lot of utility in their application to estimating spatially variable elevation uncertainty. In this session we introduce the concepts of fuzzy logic, and fuzzy inference systems and show how Wheaton et al. (2010) applied these to producing robust, spatially variable estimates of DEM elevation uncertainty.  The cartoon below  (click on for larger version), shows an FIS with three inputs used to estimate elevation uncertainty in meters.

#### Why we're Covering it

Fuzzy inference systems are supported in the GCD Software and the appropriate construction, calibration and applications of FIS is a critical skill to develop. In this section we focus on understanding how they work and their application; whereas in the [next topic]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/workshop-topics/versions/3-day-workshop/2-errors-uncertainties/p-building-your-own-fis), we work on the construction and calibration aspects. 

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
