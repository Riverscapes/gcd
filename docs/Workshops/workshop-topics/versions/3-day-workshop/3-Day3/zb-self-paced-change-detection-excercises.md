#### Synopsis of Topic

We will be on hand to help you put into practice the principles from this workshop on your own datasets. 

#### Why we're Covering it

This is the opportunity for you to reinforce the concepts and skills you've developed on Monday and Tuesday and apply them to data that you have first hand experience with. Whether you work up your own data that you brought with you or data that you captured during the field trip, we will help make sure you understand the workflows.
