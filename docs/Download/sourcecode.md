# GCD 6

GCD 6 exists in a few different flavors. The GCD 6 ArcGIS Add-In is a C# project coded in Visual Studio that makes calls to an underlying GCDCore library written in C++, as well as a [RasterMan Library](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman)  also written in C++. There is a command-line version of GCD that makes calls to the same C++ libraries. Given how finicky the Add-In program is, we have not made that open source and instead freeware. However, the underlying libraries that all the computations and GCD functionality is based on are all open source. 

### RasterMan Library
<img class="float-left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rasterman.png">  
The [RasterMan Library](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman) is used in GCD and other tools and is an open source library of common raster geoprocessing calls written in C++ and available in Win32, Win64, Ubuntu12.04 and OSX 10.10 builds. A GitHub repository of the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman). <a class="hollow button" href="https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>  RasterMan on GitHub </a>
