# GCD 7

With GCD 7, the entire code is now fully open source and available in the [Riverscapes Consoritum](http://riverscapes.xyz) [Github Organization](https://github.com/Riverscapes). With GCD 7, the entire project was refactored into C#.

# GCD 6

GCD 6 exists in a few different flavors. The GCD 6 ArcGIS Add-In is a C# project coded in Visual Studio that makes calls to an underlying GCDCore library written in C++, as well as a [RasterMan Library](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman)  also written in C++. There is a command-line version of GCD that makes calls to the same C++ libraries. Given how finicky the Add-In program is, we have not made that open source and instead freeware. However, the underlying libraries that all the computations and GCD functionality is based on are all open source. 

### RasterMan Library
<img class="float-left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rasterman.png">  
The [RasterMan Library](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman) is used in GCD and other tools and is an open source library of common raster geoprocessing calls written in C++ and available in Win32, Win64, Ubuntu12.04 and OSX 10.10 builds. A GitHub repository of the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman). <a class="hollow button" href="https://github.com/NorthArrowResearch/rasterman"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>  RasterMan on GitHub </a>

# GCD 4

The [GCD 4.0 Beta](https://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/gcd/downloads/older-versions/gcd-4-0) was the first non-MatLAB release of the Geomorphic Change Detection software. GCD 4  was developed by [Chris Garrard](http://www.cgarrard.com/) of the [RSGIS Lab](http://www.gis.usu.edu/) at Utah State University and Joe Wheaton. Plugins to [ArcGIS 9.3](http://etal.usu.edu/GCD/GCD4/Arc9_Plugin/GCDArc9Setup.msi) and [ArcGIS 10.x](http://etal.usu.edu/GCD/GCD4/Arc10_Plugin/GCDArc10Setup.msi) as well as a Windows [Stand-alone](http://etal.usu.edu/GCD/GCD4/StandAlone/GCDWinSetup.msi) flavor were all produce. Funding for the software development was provided by the Intermountain Center for River Restoration and Rehabilitation (ICRRR).

# DoD 3 (Matlab) / GCD 3

For those of you Matlab hold outs out there, [Joe](http://joewheaton.org) originally coded the [GCD up in Matlab](https://github.com/joewheaton/DoD/). You can still access the source code here:
