<h3 id="making-feature-requests">Making Feature Requests</h3>

<p>We would like to hear what you have to say about the future direction of GCD development! Send feature requests to gcd@joewheaton.org.</p>

<h3 id="how-features-are-funded">How Features are Funded</h3>

<p>The GCD Software is free and always will be under the <a href="http://gcd.joewheaton.org/versions/gcd5/readme-for-gcd-5">GNU Public License</a>. The backend C++ library is open source, and the ArcGIS plug-in user interface is freeware. However, nothing is ever really for free. We have been able to complete this works thanks to the generous grants and contracts of our partners. The research and software development to date has been funded from a mix of public and private funds. Future software development and features are partly dependent on our ability to continue to secure grants and contracts to do this work. However, many small features, bug fixes and improvements can be made with smaller investments and donations from users.</p>

<h3 id="want-to-donate-to-the-cause">Want to Donate to the Cause?</h3>

<p>We have started a PayPal donation account for users who want to see specific features added to the GCD. You can contribute as little as $10 to the cause, or as much as 500. If you want to put your donation toward a specific development feature, please copy the URL from the feature in the forum, and we will apply your money toward that task.  Donations are accepted in any amount, and when we reach a threshold of donations for a specific feature, we will develop it and publish a new release.  You can make a secure donation below using PayPal:</p>
