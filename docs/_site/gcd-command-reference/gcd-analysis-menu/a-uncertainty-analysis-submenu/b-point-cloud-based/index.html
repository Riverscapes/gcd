<p>The Point Cloud Based Uncertainty Analysis tools include two tools: the Coincident Point Tools and Brasington et al (2013)’s ToPCAT Detrended Standard Deviation tool. These tools both require high density (circa. &gt; 5 points/m2) point clouds.</p>

<p>The Point Cloud Based Uncertainty Analysis sub menu is located under the Analysis –&gt; Uncertainty Analysis sub menu:</p>
