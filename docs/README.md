# üßº Clean Template Site

This project demonstrates the smallest possible Docusaurus site setup. It is designed for simplicity and ease of use, requiring only essential files and folders.

---

## How It Works

- **Write Content:**  
  Add your documentation as Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files in the `docs` directory.

- **Add Images:**  
  Place any images you want to use in your docs inside the `img` folder.

- **Custom Components:**  
  You can automatically use React TSX components provided by the [Riverscapes Docusaurus Theme](https://github.com/Riverscapes/riverscapes-docusaurus-theme) directly in your MDX files‚Äîno extra setup required.

---

## Why This Structure?

- **No unnecessary files:**  
  Only the core configuration and content folders are included.

- **Easy to maintain:**  
  Just focus on writing docs and adding images.

- **Extendable:**  
  Leverage custom React components for richer documentation.
