title: Add All Change Detections (With These DEM Surveys) to the Map
---

This `Add All Change Detections (With These DEM Surveys) to the Map` command works similar to the [`Add All DEM Surveys to Map`](http://gcd6help.joewheaton.org/gcd-command-reference/gcd-project-explorer/b-inputs-context-menu/ii-add-all-dem-surveys-and-aois-to-map) command, but only adds all change detections within the Epoch.  This is a convenient command if you want to add various uncertainty analyses you performed of the same DoD to the map and compare them.
