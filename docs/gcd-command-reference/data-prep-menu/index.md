The old [`Data Preparation` Menu](http://gcd6help.joewheaton.org/gcd-command-reference/data-prep-menu) from GCD 6 contained a number of stand-alone tools that can help in preparing data for subsequent use in a GCD Project. The tools have more generic applications than their use within the context of a GCD project. As such, in GCD 7 we moved these to their own Add-in we call TAT - Topographic Analysis Tools.
