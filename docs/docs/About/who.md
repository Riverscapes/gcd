# Project Inception & Vision

## The Early Days

The GCD Software ![GCD Icon](/img/icons/GCDAddIn.png) was originally developed by [Joe Wheaton](http://www.joewheaton.org) ([Utah State University Department of Watershed Sciences](http://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/)) and [James Brasington](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/staff-profiles/people/jbrasing) ([University of Waikato, New Zealand](https://www.waikato.ac.nz)).

Joe and James began collaborating on geomorphic change detection in 2004 during Joe's PhD. During his Master's with [Greg Pasternack](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/), Joe used James' early work in topographic change detection and surveying (Brasington et al. 2001, 2003). They soon developed the first version of GCD (DoD 1) in Matlab. Originally meant for Joe’s workflow, it quickly proved helpful for the broader geomorphology community.

## Evolving Vision

Joe observed that many practitioners weren’t applying even basic minimum levels of detection in their DEM analyses—especially in low-change environments like rivers. By making this easier through software, he aimed to raise standards in geomorphic analysis. GCD would help reduce methodological hurdles and allow users to focus on meaningful interpretation and theory-building.

In 2009, at Utah State University, Joe connected with [Paul Grams](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/paul-grams) and received funding for GCD 4. At a 2010 NSF LiDAR workshop, Joe met [Philip Bailey](http://northarrowresearch.com/#people), then at ESSA. Joe was teaching [DoD 3](https://github.com/joewheaton/DoD); Philip, the [River Bathymetry Toolkit](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/river_bathymetry_toolkit.shtml). Their shared background sparked collaboration, and they have worked on GCD ever since.

## Expanding Horizons

In 2015, Joe, James, and [Damia Vericat](http://www.damiavericat.eu/) authored a review article on the Morphological Approach ([Vericat et al., 2017](http://etal.joewheaton.org/new-fhc-publications/gravel-bed-rivers-chapter-on-revisiting-the-morphological-approach-finally-out)). This formed the basis of a successful 2016 UK NERC proposal, partnering with New Zealand councils and SEPA to refine GCD for gravel-bed river management.

# Development Team

![Matt Reimer](/img/people/Matt_round.png)

The latest version of GCD is being developed by [North Arrow Research](http://northarrowresearch.com/) and [ET-AL](http://etal.joewheaton.org/).

Since [GCD 5](/Download/old_versions.html#gcd-5), [Philip Bailey](http://northarrowresearch.com/#people) has led development and architecture. He and [Matt Reimer](http://northarrowresearch.com/#people) are now the primary developers. Together with Joe, they launched the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net).
