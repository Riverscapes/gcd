# Open GCD Project

If you have previously created a [GCD project](/Concepts/projects), you can reload it at any time using the **Open Project** command. 
Opening an existing project brings up a standard browse dialog filtered to [GCD project files](/Concepts/projects) (`*.gcd`). Attempting to open an existing project while you already have one open will close the current project.
