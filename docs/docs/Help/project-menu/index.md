The Project menu is the main entry point to begin using the GCD software. The menu items differ slightly between the AddIn and standalone versions, with the main difference being that the standalone version maintains a list of recently opened projects.

- [Recent GCD Projects](/Help/project-menu/recent) (standalone only)

In addition to the above commands, the [GCD Project Explorer](/Help/GCD_Project_Explorer) can be accessed within the AddIn by clicking the GCD icon at the left edge of the GCD toolbar.
