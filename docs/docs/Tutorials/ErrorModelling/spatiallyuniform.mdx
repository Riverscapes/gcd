There are three methods for associating an error model (or surface), with a DEM survey in GCD:

1. Add an Existing Error Surface
2. Calculate an Error Surface
   - Specify a Spatially Uniform Error Surface
   - Load an Associated Surface as an Error Surface
   - Run a spatially-variable FIS Error Model
3. Calculate Error Surface with a Mask
