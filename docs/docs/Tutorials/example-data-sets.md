# Example Datasets

import { ToolsWrapper } from "../src/components/ToolsWrapper/ToolsWrapper";

These example datasets are used in the [tutorials](/Tutorials) and [command reference](/Help) examples. Although all of the current examples here are fluvial, the principles and techniques can be applied to a broad range of physiographic settings and situations.
