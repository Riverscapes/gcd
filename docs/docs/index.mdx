    The GCD software was developed primarily for topographic change detection in rivers, but will work for simple, raster-based change detection of any two surfaces. The volumetric change in storage is calculated from the difference in surface elevations from digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from repeat topographic surveys. 
 
    GCD is part of the <a href="https://riverscapes.net">Riverscapes Consortium's</a> much larger family of tools for analyzing riverscapes. GCD is the Riverscapes Consortium's longest-standing, best developed software with the largest user base. GCD has users all over the world.

## GCD Research

The methodological development is described in ([Wheaton et al., 2010a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1886)), the Wheaton ([2008](http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/Home/research/projects-1/morphological-sediment-budgeting/phdthesis)) thesis, and the Wheaton et al. ([2010b](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.1305)) RRA paper. The [Matlab version of the code](/Download/old_versions#dod-3-matlab--gcd-3) (DoD 3) is provided as supplemental information with the [ESPL paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1886) so that readers can test or extend the code as they see fit for their purposes.

## What's Next for GCD

GCD 7 is always in development. How active that development is depends on our [funding levels](/About/acknowledgements). We post our wish list of enhancements on our [GCD GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/gcd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement). If you have ideas of your own then please [suggest and enhancecment](/Download/future-feature-request#making-feature-requests), or would like to support these efforts please consider [donating](/Download/future-feature-request#want-to-donate-to-the-cause).

## Note on Terminology

**DoD** is an acronym for DEM (digital elevation model) of Difference (not [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/)). DoDs are derived from repeat topographic surveys and used in change detection studies and morphological sediment budgeting. We use **GCD** to mean geomorphic change detection, not [Glen Canyon Dam](https://www.usbr.gov/uc/rm/crsp/gc).
