    The GCD software was developed primarily for topographic change detection in rivers, but will work for simple, raster-based change detection of any two surfaces. The volumetric change in storage is calculated from the difference in surface elevations from digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from repeat topographic surveys. 
 
    GCD is part of the <a href="https://riverscapes.net">Riverscapes Consortium's</a> much larger family of tools for analyzing riverscapes. GCD is the Riverscapes Consortium's longest-standing, best developed software with the largest user base. GCD has users all over the world.

## What's Next for GCD

GCD development is ramping up again after a hiatus of several years. We have just released a beta version of a new [GCD Viewer for ArcGIS Pro](/Download). We are also scoping a new GCD platform in Python. This will mean a new Standalone and plugin for QGIS, as well as developer APIs for incorporating GCD into your own workflows. A mockup of these new tools is shown below.

We are currently seeking funding to support this development. If you are interested in supporting this work, please contact us at [support@riverscapes.freshdesk.com](mailto:support@riverscapes.freshdesk.com).

## Citation

If you use the GCD Software, please cite the following publication:

Phlip Bailey, Joseph Wheaton, Matt Reimer, & James Brasington. (2020). Geomorphic Change Detection Software (7.5.0). Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7248344](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7248344)


## GCD Research

The methodological development is described in ([Wheaton et al., 2010a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1886)), the Wheaton ([2008](http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/Home/research/projects-1/morphological-sediment-budgeting/phdthesis)) thesis, and the Wheaton et al. ([2010b](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.1305)) RRA paper. The [Matlab version of the code](/Download/old_versions#dod-3-matlab--gcd-3) (DoD 3) is provided as supplemental information with the [ESPL paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1886) so that readers can test or extend the code as they see fit for their purposes.

## Note on Terminology

**DoD** is an acronym for DEM (digital elevation model) of Difference (not [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/)). DoDs are derived from repeat topographic surveys and used in change detection studies and morphological sediment budgeting. We use **GCD** to mean geomorphic change detection, not [Glen Canyon Dam](https://www.usbr.gov/uc/rm/crsp/gc).
