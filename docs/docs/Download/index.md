The GCD 7 software is available in two different versions: 

:::info
GCD performs all spatial operations using the free and open source GDAL library. You do not need ArcGIS to use GCD Standalone.

      imageUrl: "/img/gcd_addin.png",
      toolUrl: "https://github.com/Riverscapes/gcd/releases/latest",
      description: "Provides full GCD functionality, including map display of GCD inputs and outputs. If you have ArcGIS 10.4 or newer (not ArcPro) then this version will give you 'Add to Map' and spatial visualization functionality embedded within ArcGIS. The downside is ArcGIS is a 32 Bit Application and can only use 4 GB of RAM, so it is slower. "

      title: "GCD 7 Standalone",
      imageUrl: "/img/gcd_standalone.png",
      toolUrl: "https://github.com/Riverscapes/gcd/releases/latest",
      description: "Performs all core GCD functionality (building projects and performing change detection analyses etc) but does not include any map display. If you don't possess ArcGIS, or you want to use an alternative map display tool, such as QGIS, then we recommend this version. The standalone is natively 64 bit."
