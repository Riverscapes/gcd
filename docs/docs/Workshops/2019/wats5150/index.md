## Partial Syllabus


January 7-  April 23, 2019 in Logan @ USU. Geomorphic Change Detection will be taught as part of [WATS 5150/6150](/Workshops/About/how-to-register#usu-graduate--undergraduate-students---wats-51506150) Fluvial Geomorphology class for matriculated USU students. Undergraduates should register for 5150 and graduates for 6150. The course is focused on understanding the geomorphology of channel change, and we use the geomorphic change detection software as a tool for analyzing such processes.

Note: This is only a syllabus for the GCD Portion of WATS 5150/6150. See [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/532404) for rest.

## Course Texts
We will rely heavily on the primary literature for [course readings](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/532404/files/folder/readings). Readingssignments will be set in [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/532404/assignments), and follow up references will be set . However, we will use one  text for this course as a reference on understanding fluvial systems and interpreting geomorphic changes. See
