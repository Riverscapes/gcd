Join us to learn the latest version of the GCD Software, meet the GCD development team and take your data further in the first public GCD Workshop in two years.
Over five days you will be taught change detection fundamentals as well a deep dive into the new features of the completely overhauled GCD 7 software. 

Existing GCD users are encouraged to bring their own topographic data. Project-based sessions are scheduled during which the instruction team will be available to answer questions
and help take your GCD use to the next level. Example datasets will be provided for new GCD users.

## Course Texts

We will rely heavily on the primary literature for course readings. Reading assignments will be set. However, we will use one  text for this course as a reference on understanding fluvial systems and interpreting geomorphic changes.
