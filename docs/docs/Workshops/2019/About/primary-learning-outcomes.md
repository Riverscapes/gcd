# Primary Learning Outcomes

Participants should come away with:

1. A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
2. The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
3. Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
4. Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
5. An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
