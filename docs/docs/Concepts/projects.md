GCD organizes data and analyses into "projects". GCD projects are self contained. You can move the folder containing the GCD project to a different location on your computer and it will continue to work. You can also compress a GCD project folder into a zip archive and share it with other users. A GCD project consists of three primary elements:

1. A folder (fixed path) on your file system where the project and its contents exist.
2. A `*.gcd` [project file](/gcd-concepts/project/-gcd-files) that defines the location of layers within the project.
3. All the GCD [input](/gcd-concepts/project/inputs-folder) and [output](/gcd-concepts/project/analsyses-folder) files stored in sub-folders of the project folder

## Sharing GCD Projects


Zipping up a GCD Project and all of its contents is easy, and anyone with the same version of GCD can [open up your project](/Help/project-menu/open-project.html) and view the results. We illustrate how below:
