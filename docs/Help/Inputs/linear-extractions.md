title: Linear Extractions
---

Linear extractions are the product of reading the values of a DEM survey or DoD raster along the polylines contained in a profile route. Each linear extraction operations produces a CSV file that contains the raster values from the associated raster at user-defined stations along the polylines stored within a vector ShapeFile. Values from a corresponding error surface are also written to the linear exctration CSV file, taken from the same coincident points as the values from the DEM or DoD raster.
