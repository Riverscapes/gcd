Error surfaces are rasters that share that represent the uncertainty within a DEM Survey. The values in an error surface possess the same vertical units as those of the corresponding DEM. Moreover since error surfaces belong to a parent DEM survey there are specific requirements regarding these rasters. Error surface rasters and the parent DEM survey must have **identical**:

* spatial reference
* cell resolution
* spatial extent
