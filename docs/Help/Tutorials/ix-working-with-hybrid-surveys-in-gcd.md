title: 09. Working with Hybrid Surveys in GCD
---

The GCD supports the use of hybrid multi-method surveys in the [`Survey Library`]({{ site.baseurl }}/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:3ed05905e41de6f6). GCD allows you to load a survey method mask, which then is used to calculate errors using different methods within the different masks. In this video tutorial, we illustrate how this is done for two examples from a reach called Pats Cabin in Bridge Creek, Oregon:
