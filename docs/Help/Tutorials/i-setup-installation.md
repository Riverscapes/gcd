GCD 6 is an` *.ESRIaddin`, which are much simpler to install to ArcGIS then PlugIns. The AddIn is actually a small zip file and can be sent via email (unlike an `*.msi` installer). 

## ArcGIS 10.X AddIn

### Installation Procedure

The installation procedure for an ArcGIS AddIn is incredibly simple. All you do is double click on the *.ESRIaddin

and the software is installed. Although you can get away with doing this whether or not ArcMap is running or not, we recommend installing the AddIn while ArcMap is closed.

#### Noted Issue for Internet Explorer Users

- **Simply change the .zip extension to .esriAddIn before extracting the contents of the file**
- After the file extension has been changed accordingly you can double click the .esriAddIn file to correctly install the GCD Add-In

### Uninstall Procedure

To uninstall an AddIn, you simply go to the Customize -> Add In Manager command in ArcMap and uninstall. The video illustrates this:

### UpGrade Procedure
