If you have previously created a [GCD project]({{ site.baseurl }}/Concepts/projects.html), you can reload it at any time using the **Open Project** command. 
Opening an existing project brings up a standard browse dialog filtered to [GCD project files]({{ site.baseurl }}/Concepts/projects.html) (`*.gcd`). Attempting to open an existing project while you already have one open will close the current project.
