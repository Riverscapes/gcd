#### Field Trip

We will provide transportation for the field trip on Monday. The field trip will be out to the Logan River. 

You will want waders and wading boots. Please ensure that your waders and boots have been properly disinfected, cleaned and dried. If you don't have your own waders let us know so we can bring some for you. We recommended that you bring:

- Chest waders and wading boots (thoroughly dried and disinfected w/ bleach or 409 solution)
- A dry change of clothes (just in case) never hurts 
- Thermal layers for inclement weather
- Outer shell rain jacket for potential rain/snow
- A hat
- Sunglasses (polarized help for seeing in the water)
- Sunscreen
- A water bottle
- A camera (optional)
- A notepad and pencil (optional)

Spring weather can change quickly. Dress accordingly and be prepared for rain or light snow if we happen to be that unlucky.
