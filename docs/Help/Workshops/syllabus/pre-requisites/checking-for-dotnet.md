title: Checking for DotNet
---

Windows 7 users won't need to worry about this. However, Windows XP users might need to read below.

Any users attempting to install [GCD 5 ](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD)on a machine with Windows XP Pro, need to ensure that **before** ArcGIS is installed, DotNet Version 3.5 or later is installed (see [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en) to install DotNet 4.0).  If .Net Framework Version 3.5 or later is not installed first, ArcGIS will not install the .NET components necessary to run the GCD 5 tools. See [here](http://essa.com/tools/RBT/Help/RBT_Help.htm#Important.htm)for more information. Windows 7 users do not need to worry about this because .Net comes pre-installed. 

If you are unsure whether or not you have .NET installed, see this video:

If you know you have .NET installed, but are not sure if ArcGIS was installed after or before this, you may need to follow [these instructions](http://essa.com/tools/RBT/Help/RBT_Help.htm#Important.htm).

### What is DotNet anyway?

Similar to how many applications and software coded in [Java](http://www.java.com/), require you to have the Java runtime installed on your machine, programs coded using Microsoft's [Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/ms789056) or [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336706) languages require you to have [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) installed to run.  All [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/)  is:

- Common Language Runtime – provides an abstraction layer over the operating system
- Base Class Libraries – pre-built code for common low-level programming tasks
- Development frameworks and technologies – reusable, customizable solutions for larger programming tasks
