title: Recap of Day / Preview of day 2
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

 We will recap the information covered on Day 1 with an emphasis on realizing that there are many ways to undertake change detection analyses and we are not advocating any single technique. Instead, we are trying to equip you to make an informed and appropriate decision based on your circumstances about how to proceed through the process of geomorphic change detection. Ultimately, Day 1 is boring, due diligence you need to undertake in order to explore interesting applications and make reasonable interpretations of your repeat topographic surveys with some confidence.

#### Why we're Covering it

- To make sure that workshop participants are confident in understanding the basics of change detection and surveying principles, before doing more sophisticated error analyses & change detection or using these techniques in any sort of interpretative fashion ([Day 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/workshop-topics/versions/2-day-workshop/anzgg-workshop-topics/2-application-interpretations-of-change-detection-day-2)) .
