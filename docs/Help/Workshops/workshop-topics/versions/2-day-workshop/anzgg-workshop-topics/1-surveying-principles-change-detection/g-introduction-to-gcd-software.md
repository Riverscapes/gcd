title: Change Detection in Raster Calculator vs. GCD
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

In this hands on exercise we will learn how to do a basic change detection using geoprocessing in ArcGIS, vs. in GCD 6.

#### Why we're Covering it

Before we get used to GCD 6 as a black box that works, its important to understand how to manually do the analysis.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
