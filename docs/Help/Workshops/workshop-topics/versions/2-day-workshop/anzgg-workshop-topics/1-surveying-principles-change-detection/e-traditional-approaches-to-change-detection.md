title: Traditional Approaches to Change Detection
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

Traditional geomorphic change detection is based on some pretty basic concepts and simple assumptions that allow us to conduct very simple spatial analysis operations to show where change has occurred and quantify it. The major challenge of course comes in distinguishing the 'real' net change we're interested in from noise inherit in the data. The basic principles of error estimation, error propagation and how you can do this in ArcGIS are covered in this session.

#### Why we're Covering it

You have to learn to crawl before you can walk. And in a lot of circumstances, simply crawling maybe good enough to get you there. Plus, it is important to understand what so many previous investigators have done to perform these types of analyses.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
