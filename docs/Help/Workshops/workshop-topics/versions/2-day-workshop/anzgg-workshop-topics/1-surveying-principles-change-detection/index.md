title: Surveying Principles & Change Detection
---

Our aim on Day 1 is to bring everyone in the workshop up to speed on how we acquire topographic data to support change detection, how we prepare for it change detection, and the fundamentals of uncertainty analysis and error propagation to enable change detection. We will be switching back and forth between lectures/discussions on the theory and principles, and hands-on exercises putting those ideas into practice.  This day is primarily in support of our first two [primary learning outcomes](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes):

1. A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
2. The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
