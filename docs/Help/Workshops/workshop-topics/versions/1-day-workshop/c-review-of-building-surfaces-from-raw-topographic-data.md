title: Review of Building Surfaces from Raw Topographic Data
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

In this section we will go through the basics of creating topographic surfaces as raster digital elevation models from raw topographic data. We will use a standard and accepted technique of deriving a TIN first, then editing it to remove problematic interpolations, and then converting this TIN surface to a raster DEM surface.

#### Why we're Covering it

- Make sure everyone is on the same page with regards to where raster DEMs we use in change detection come from.
- Show participants some tricks in creating such surfaces that may increase their efficiency and proficiency at building surfaces.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

 This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
