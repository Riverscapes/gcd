title: Surveying Principles & Prepping for Change Detection (Day 1)
---

Our aim on Day 1 is to bring everyone in the workshop up to speed on how we acquire topographic data to support change detection, and how we prepare for it change detection. We will be switching back and forth between lectures/discussions on the theory and principles, and hands-on exercises putting those ideas into practice. We will also spend half the day in the field reviewing standard topographic survey practice. This day is primarily in support of our first two [primary learning outcomes]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes):

1. The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
