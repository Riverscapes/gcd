title: Field Trip to Logan River
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

During our field trip, we will leverage the CHaMP ([Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program](http://champmonitoring.org/)) Protocol (2014) for guidance on how to use a topographically stratified survey approach to paint a topographic picture of a study site. 

We will split up into three groups and rotate through three hands-on instruction sessions:

1. Control Networks & rtkGPS Surveying
2. Topographic Surveying with a Total Station
3. Point sampling strategy and auxiliary data collection

#### Why we're Covering it

This will help highlight best survey practices for ground-based rtkGPS and total station surveys and the importance of robust control networks to facilitate repeat topographic surveys that can support change detection.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
