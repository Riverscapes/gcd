title: Workshop Synthesis
---

#### Synopsis of Topic

In this final segment, we will briefly summarize and review the main concepts we want you to leave the workshop with. We will highlight the skills you need to put those concepts into practice on your own projects and remind you where you can access the follow up resources to help you do it. 

#### Why we're Covering it

The workshop is designed as a firehose of information, but this website is organized to help you digest and access that information in a useful way as you move forward and potentially begin to apply the principles covered here. The synthesis is a chance to pull all that scattered information we've thrown at you in the past three days and put it back together into some coherent take home points.
