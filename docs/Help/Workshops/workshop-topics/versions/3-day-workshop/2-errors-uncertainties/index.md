title: Error Modelling & Uncertainty Accounting to Support Change Detection (Day 2)
---

After having established the foundations that enable us to undertake geomorphic change detection rigorously, we will focus on[ primary learning outcomes]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) 3 and 4:

- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software ](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD)through group-led and self-paced exercises
