title: Ground Based LiDaR & SFM Survey of EmRiver Flume
---

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

We'll be playing in the sandbox this morning... that's right, role up your sleeaves and watch geomorphic change right before your eyes in an [EmRiver flume](http://www.emriver.com/?page_id=834). We'll measure/survey the topographic changes we see with both a TLS (terrestrial laser scanner) and a camera.  In so doing, we'll learn more about where high resolution point clouds come from.

#### Why we're Covering it

There are three reasons why we're covering this:

1. Help you see geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition and storage in action
2. Introduce/expose you to ground-based LiDAR as means of capturing snapshots of topography
3. Introduce/expose you to SFM (structure from motion) photogrammetry as a cheap way to acquire high resolution point clouds.

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)](http://gcdworkshop.joewheaton.org/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- A comprehensive overview of the theory underpinning geomorphic change detection
- The fundamental background necessary to design effective repeat topographic monitoring campaigns and distinguish geomorphic changes from noise (with particular focus on restoration applications)
- Methods for interpreting and segregating morphological sediment budgets quantitatively in terms of both geomorphic processes and changes in physical habitat
- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
- An opportunity to interact with experts on geomorphic monitoring and the software developers of GCD to help you make better use of your own data
