title: Prepping Surveys & Building Error Models for Change Detection
---

### Synopsis of Topic

We've spent a full day talking about error modelling, and its easy to get lost in the weeds of uncertainty. This last topic is all about pulling the concepts together and putting your FIS error model into practice.

#### Why we're Covering it

Apply what you've learned about error modelling to a change detection problem from the flume data. 

#### Learning Outcomes Supported

This topic will help fulfill the following [primary learning outcome(s)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Workshops/syllabus/primary-learning-outcomes) for the workshop:

- Hands-on instruction on use of the [GCD software](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research/software/GCD) through group-led and self-paced exercises
