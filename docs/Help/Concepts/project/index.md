A project consists of three primary elements:

1. A folder (fixed path) on your file system where the project and its contents exist.
2. A `*.gcd` Project File
3. All the GCD input and output files (in subfolders of project folder)

Projects are created and accessed via the [*Project Menu*]({{ site.baseurl }}/gcd-command-reference/project-menu).

#### Project Components

- [Inputs Folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/gcd-concepts/project/inputs-folder)
