# GCD Refactoring notes

* Remember to replace MsgBox with MessageBox
* Consistent exception handling using `GCD.GCDLib.CoreExceptionHelper` class
* Every public event entry point to code has `try/catch`
* Search for all occurances of `TODO`
* review all commented out code
* remove all unused `imports/using` statements
